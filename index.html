<h2>Saturn V</h2>

<p>The Saturn V rocket was 363 ft tall. It weighed at least 6,221,000 lbs! It was launched in NASA's</p>
<p>Kennedy Space Center, on one of the launch pads Elon Musk uses to launch rockets like the Falcon Heavy rocket today!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saturn V burned Kerosene and Hydrogen Fuel at an astounding rate of 20 tonnes of fuel per second!</p>
<p>Some experts beleive that the fuel input was equal to the energy input of the entrire UK at the time!</p>
<p>What monstrous engines could burn this fuel? The F1 engines, the largest engines ever used in Space Flight.</p>
<p>These engines were big enough to comfortably fit a grown man inside.</p>
<p>The âˆ†v of the Apollo Lunar Module, nicknamed 'The Eagle', was about 2470 m/s.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Not all Space Missions land on the moon, however. Most Space Missions, manned and unmanned, are going into</p>
<p>orbit. There are three types of orbit: Geostationary Orbit, where the Sattelite points at one point on</p>
<p>Earth, Low Earth Orbit, where it circles just above the atmosphere, and Polar Orbit, orbiting around the north and south poles.</p>
<h2>How to Maneuver an Orbiting Satellite and Capsule</h2>
<p></p>
<p>There are two points on an orbit that Mission Control is</p>
<p>interested in. The apoapsis, the highest point in the orbit,</p>
<p>and the periapsis, the lowest point in the orbit. If the orbit</p>
<p>is perfectly circular, they will be the same. How do you change</p>
<p>these orbits? To raise one point, burn prograde (in the direction</p>
<p>of travel) at the other point, and to raise a point, burn retrogade</p><p>(away from the direction of travel) at the other point.</p>
